# Contact

Some words about what types of contact and questions people can submit: blog post submissions, event ideas, talk proposals, an general questions.

For blog post and talk submissions, instead of using the form perhaps we should give instructions for filing an issue on github. Then we can also mention that people not comfortable with github can use the contact form instead.

The contact form is defined in templates/contact.njk
